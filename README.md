# [Melody/E-Commerce Admin Dashboard] - Performance-Focused Data Access

This project is a comprehensive administrative dashboard for an e-commerce platform, built to showcase **advanced Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** and **LINQ** query optimization techniques. Unlike typical CRUD-only applications, this dashboard emphasizes high-performance data retrieval, complex relational queries, and dynamic filtering to provide real-time business metrics.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights & Technical Focus

This dashboard is a direct application of professional-level data access patterns used in real-world .NET applications:

### üöÄ Data Retrieval Performance

* **Tracking-Free Queries:** Utilized **`AsNoTracking()`** extensively for all read-only dashboard components (KPI cards, charts) to significantly reduce memory overhead and maximize query speed.
* **Optimized Aggregation:** Employed highly optimized LINQ aggregation methods like **`LongCount`** for calculating large datasets (e.g., total customer/product counts) without unnecessary materialization.
* **Efficient Value Retrieval:** Focused on selecting only necessary columns/values using **Projection (`.Select()`)** to minimize data transfer from the database.

### üìä Advanced LINQ and Relational Management

* **Complex Joins:** Implemented **`GroupJoin`** and advanced **Navigation Properties** to accurately calculate relational data shown in charts (e.g., "Customer Distribution by City").
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Developed flexible queries using LINQ chain methods to handle business logic like "Products with Stock Between 50-100" and "Products above a specific price threshold."
* **Data Grouping:** Used the **`GroupBy`** operator to generate time-series data for the "Daily Order Trends" chart, demonstrating proficiency in complex data transformations.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies Used

* **.NET [Core/6/7/8]:** The core framework for the application.
* **Entity Framework Core [Specify Version]:** The ORM layer handling all database interactions.
* **[ASP.NET Core MVC/Razor Pages/Blazor]:** The frontend technology used for rendering the dashboard UI.
* **[Database Type - e.g., SQL Server]:** The underlying database system.

## üìà Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides the following key views (as seen in the screenshots):

* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Real-time metrics like Customer Count, Total Product Stock, Average Customer Balance, etc.
* **Activity Monitoring:** A feed showing recent logistic and operational activities.
* **Order and Status Tracking:** Donut charts displaying the distribution of orders by current status (Shipped, Pending, Cancelled).
* **Trend Analysis:** A line chart showing daily/weekly order volume trends.
* **Detailed Lists:** Displays of recent orders, top products, and a to-do list for administrative tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

### Prerequisites

* .NET SDK [Specify Version, e.g., 8.0]
* [Database Tool - e.g., SQL Server Management Studio or Docker]

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd [PROJECT_FOLDER]
    ```
2.  **Update Database Connection:**
    * Modify the connection string in `appsettings.json` (or similar file) to point to your local database instance.
3.  **Run Migrations:**
    * Execute EF Core migrations to create the database schema:
        ```bash
        dotnet ef database update
        ```
4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    * The application should start, typically at `http://localhost:5000` or a similar port.

## ü§ù Contributing

Suggestions for further optimization (e.g., implementing **`AsSplitQuery()`** or moving to **compiled models**) are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
